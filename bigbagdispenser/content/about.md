The Raimo Big Bag Dispenser is a unique discharger for partially emptying bulk bags of fertilizer, seed, pelleted feed and other types of free flowing material. It originated in Finland as a result of fertilizer manufacturers starting to use bulk bags [FIBCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_intermediate_bulk_container). It soon became apparent that the safe and efficient handling of bulk bags on the farm demanded a reliable discharger, especially in situations when a full bag was not needed. Over the years, Raimo Big Bag Dispenser has become an internationally acclaimed piece of equipment for handling bulk bags with fertiliser, and the number of different materials that Raimo is used with has also expanded. 

Today, Raimo is used with various free-flowing materials including:
* seed
* pelleted feed
* salt
* gravel
* wood pellets
* plastics and various chemical products.

# The Product
The Raimo Big-Bag Dispenser consists of three parts.
## The Main Dispenser
*Diameter 4.33 inches*

Two cutting blades (covered by a safety guard) penetrate the bag liner while a slide opens and closes the dispenser.

## The Locking Ring
A threaded ring catches the liner of the bag ensuring the dispenser is securely fastened.

## The Extension Tube
A flexible plastic tube attaches to the main part of the dispenser with a snap-on fitting, directing the material to where it needs to go.
