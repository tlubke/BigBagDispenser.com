# How robust is Raimo, and how long will it last?

It is made from a very durable plastic and all metal (screws, cutting blades and metal parts on the extension tube) are made of stainless steel. The main dispenser can withstand over 1 Ton of pressure.

How long it lasts depends on how often Raimo is used and what materials are used. For a farmer who uses Raimo a few times a year, the typical life span is 10+ years. We sell spare parts for the knife blades and the locking ring.

# Does Raimo come in different sizes?

No, there is only one size of Raimo. The diameter of the flow hole is **_11cm_** or approximately **_4 and 1/3 inches_**.

# What happens to the piece of material which the blades cut when installing Raimo?

Usually, Raimo does not cut a full circle when being installed. The almost-full-circle material should still be attached ot the bag and remain inside near the newly cut opening.
