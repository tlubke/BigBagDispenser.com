# Working safely

Many people simply cut or slash the bottom of a big bag to empty its contents. This can be very dangerous for the operator standing underneath.


The Raimo Big Bag Dispenser on the other hand, when operated in accordance with instructions, is a safe way of emptying a big bag in a controlled manner. 

1. Do not stand under a hanging bag. **Install the dispenser on the SIDE**, near the bottom, of the bag. 
2. **Only install the dispenser on the underside of the bag IF the bag is securely fastened** so it cannot fall down and cause injury.
3. **NEVER put a hand inside the dispenser when it is installed on the bag**. Be aware of the sharp cutting blades inside.
